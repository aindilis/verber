Culture, knowledge, wisdom and art are the divine patrimony of humanity and belong to the commons.  They are not territory to be gobbled up as if indigenous lands by opportunistic colonists who have bribed domineering yet obsequious governments into enforcing their petty claims on ideas and facts immemorial, the very fabric of thought.  There are other concerns beside those of the capitalist investors to consider.  Or do you maintain the only conceivable and justifiable motivation to develop works that can be instantly copied freely to the remotest ends of the earth to cure diseases, end hunger and sufferings, educate and edify, is to recoup a capital investment?  And what of our rights in an increasingly Kafkaesque society where commonplace atomic truths will be mechanically encoded in knowledge representation systems and patented, making it a punishable thought crime to entertain certain ideas or think in a certain way.
