So, here  is the design of  how it handles  meta-planning.  Perhaps it
would be useful to finish the bugs with CLEAR, so that I can determine
what  is going  on there.   I do  have  all that  time on  the bus  to
concentrate on programming.  During exercises, I too can exercise.

I need  to work  on building  that search system.   There are  lots of
things I can work on and basically any of them will work just fine.

So long as I am working on something.
