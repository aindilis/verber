every planner supports one or more input types
every planner supports one or more output plan types
each visualizer supports one or more plan types

? each world has a world model

? the world model consists of knowledge base, which updates its facts as the result of verified execution from the manager

for every agent, there is a manager

any manager can connect to one or more verber planners

there is only one true world

each agent maintains a model of the world, in planning it may maintain
several world models to reason with, but these are known as possible
worlds




note because the various planners can solve different problems,


How about a simplified architecture?


# all  we want  to  do for  now, is  take  all those  PDDL files,  and
generate a massive domain, and run LPG on them.  What do we need to do
for that?

# we  must list  all input  files, combine  them into  one  domain and
# problem, and generate them to two new files

# lpg requires to know these two files, and generates output files


# so  all we have  to do,  is create  a new  object containing  a PDDL
# domain, and  a PDDL  problem, iterate over  a list of  passed files,
# loading these

# then we generate the new files

# then we run the planner on them, and get back the answer
