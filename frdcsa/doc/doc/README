Here is an update of how to use this software.

I am working on  integrating bus-scheduling with the temporal planner,
so that Verber  goals can involve accurate bus  planning information -
dynamically generated from BusRoute, etc.

Add train routes to and from city, among other things, maybe google
transit.

I will also have a microtheory system where one can define, in comment
syntax, a  tpddl (template pddl - my  own term) file, so  that one can
include submicrotheorys, i.e. ";; (include Laundry BusRoute)"

But in  the mean time, I  have just started doing  plan generation and
visualization.  Right now, its not much, but here is a start.

If you have Java properly installed, you can run...

"./launch 1",

then it will load a java program.  Go into the menu and click on "load
scene", and then when it prompts, select
"plan_domains/verber-problem-1.pddl_1.SOL".  You will then see a gantt
chart for the plan.  In the future, you could visualize more complex
plans this way too.  This is the very beginnings of the Verber system
that you see on the website.  I've made a lot of progress on it today,
all because I was too lazy to try to figure out how to do my laundry,
and get a hair cut.  This is what is meant by good programmers are
lazy.
