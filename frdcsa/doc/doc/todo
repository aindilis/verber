Here is my plan for this.

I would like to generate a real plan for several days.  This includes what people eat, as well as sleep, and so on.  To get this working, we need to get Verber working in a reasonable capacity.

Perhaps I should investigate the use of GIPO by reading the manual at this point.

I can read the manual in the background.  Goal is to read the manual.

For simplicities sake, I can break the problem down into chunks.

Get the World State Manager working.  This is a system that represents
belief  in (just  saw a  paper  on belief  representation in  EPILOG),
perhaps use EPILOG or not, but  this managers the world state as known
to the computer.

The goal system posits constraints on the world state.

Plans must satisfy the constraints of the goal system.

The goal to logic translator is very important, could use WSD, Cyc, etc for that.

Or maybe just use PICForm.


At the end of the day, however, must get these things working.

We can write wrappers or virtuals which are goals that act on goals.

The whole process is an opportunity for computer learning, interacting with the user on certain ones.

For now, we could simply get Verber working pretty well, that is, taking and composing goals.

Maybe, should model everything using UML so others can work on it.

Can express goals as having preconditions, and codifying these
preconditions, and automatically recognizing which goals have which
preconditions, and then planning around achieving those preconditions,
then presenting the user with the goal.

The whole process is recursive in that if the system knew exactly what
it was that needed to be done it could essentially execute that.  Some
things require will and cannot be done (i.e. lead a horse to water but
can't make it drink).

I'm thinking just get the world state manager done for now.

That depends on the system for generating plans.

Can use a database to store states, etc.
