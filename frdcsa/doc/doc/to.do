(try the tgplan with extensions for preferences)

(figure out how we are going to have domains generated
dynamically, such as querying kbs to get the pse-x plan
information and generating a domain from that.)

(integrate agenda with verber & pse-x, i.e., so when a goal is
due, all of its dependencies had better be done before that.
Figure out about hard/soft deadlines and hard/soft goals)
