Here is the plan for verber.

;; ( We need  to get  a generation  working of a  visualization of  a plan,
;; simply taking the plan SOL file as input.)

;; (Next, we generate a working walkthrough of a plan.)

;; (Then we add unit information to the plan synthesis component.)

;; (We create a domain involving cooking velveeta.)

;; (We generate the velveeta solution, and run it with the manager component.)

Also, add multiple interface  methods, which are transparently handled
by  Manager::Modality, or maybe  something in  audience, which  in any
case handles the same  user interaction in different interfaces.  This
system should be able to  handle speech, written (terminal, etc), GUI,
and so on.

You know, the  family continued rejectance of AI  reminds me very much
of  the character  in  Candide who  refuses  to let  his sister  marry
Candide  despite all  that  the  world has  endeavored  to teach  him.
What's it going to be, another  3 years of isolation?  Seems to me its
going to be more like 20 or 40.
