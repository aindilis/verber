I want to go shopping today to pick up all the items I need.

# launch a query to determine which items we need

# look up where items maybe purchased

# generate shopping lists

# compute busroute,  with ample time to purchase  items.  Compute both
# quick plans and backups.

# generate entire plan, load into digital assistant.


Okay, we also want to use our todo lists to formalize our domain.
