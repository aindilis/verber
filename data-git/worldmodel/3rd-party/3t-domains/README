This directory contains the code for the AP-beliefs system.  This system 
converts an AP plan into a Bayesian Belief Network.

----dependencies------------
This system depends on a Lisp interface that wraps around
Netica's NeticaJ Java API. This interface, called NeticaL, uses
Allegro's Jlinker subsystem.  You must own a copy of Netica and NeticaJ.
(see http://www.norsys.com)

If you convert to a newer version of Allegro, you will have to 
recompile NeticaL.  to do that:
cl-user: (load "c:\\Program Files\\Netica\\NeticaL\\NeticaL.system")
cl-user: (compile-system :neticaL :recompile t)

You will also have to recompile the diagnostic-analysis subsystem:
cl-user: (load "ap:belief-network;diagnostic-analysis;da.system")
cl-user: (compile-system :diagnostic-analysis :recompile t)

For regular use, you should be able to load everything with the following:
cl-user:  (mk:compile-system 'ap-beliefs)
-------------------------

The system works as follows:

1) an AP plan is converted into "inodes" [for intermediate nodes].
Inodes represent each of the relations in the probability model
for the actions in the plan, and the actions in the plan.

2) indoes are converted to diagram nodes in Netica by writing
a Netica format .dne file and reading in that file. 

3) the resulting belief network can be displayed using Netica and updated
using NeticaL code.  Note that at this point, updating the Java image of the
belief network will NOT change the version loaded in the Netica GUI. that is
a Netica issue, supposed to be fixed in the future.
