This directory has several domains to give you an idea how to write planning

CL-USER> (load-system 'ap :compile t) ; or ap-gui or ap-beliefs

To get a menu asking you which domain to load:

cl-user> (load-pddl)

The current demo applications:

Blocks	Blocks world where "robot" is the ?planner
        In blocks;Multi-agent.pddl (which uses blocks)
       	Robot has two agents, strong-arm and weak-arm, and 
	the weight of the blocks matters. 

YSPv*  Variations on the Yale Shooting Problem that demonstrate
       different ways to approach domain design.
