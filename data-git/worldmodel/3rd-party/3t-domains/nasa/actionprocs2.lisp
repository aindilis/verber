recognize that the RGA is available for auto recovery. Therefore,
performing this step will also functionally disable RGA recovery.

OBJECTIVE:
Spin down and shut down one or more CMGs. Once below a predefined
threshold, the CMG is taken out of the control loop; then, power supplies are
commanded off and priorities are configured such that the CMG cannot be
incorporated back into the control loops.
NOTE
This procedure is valid for the ISS configuration after the patch panel

CMG 2 is powered by RPCM Z13B B RPC 18.

For each CMG[X] to be shut down with braking (from step 3)
NOTE
1. CMG shutdown with braking in this step will cause the CMG to spin
down. This will take ~10 to 16 hours to spin down completely.
2. Ignore 'CMG[X] Failed ' and 'CMG [X] Wheel Over/Under Speed '
advisories. These messages will be intermittent when wheel speed
is less than 3000 rpm and continuous when wheel speed is less
than 600 rpm.

5.2. Using EA Off Command

OBJECTIVE:
To transition S0 MDM from Normal/Wait to Wait/Diagnostic/Off.
NOTE
If transitioning to Diagnostic/Off, there will be a loss of insight and control into lower-tiered systems. This mainly affects TCS and EPS.
