(how to do the sync feature)
(create any new tasks that have not been seen before - deal with recurrences)

(deal with changes to time - so for instance, if a given item has
      changed title or date, update it)

(so there are a few concerns - setting up the proper dependencies on
    tasks, so for instance, if we know that a specific task depends on
    something)

(set up a test domain and include the temporal planning aspect)

(have a calendar sync, so that tasks that are scheduled, by say, a
      plan, may be uploaded to the calendar)
