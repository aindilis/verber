(why is it skipping the template domain verb file for PSEx2 when planning with federated planning.
 (because it is already generating an empty prototype to put their in it's stead)
 )

(do we want to skip the template when doing federated planning?)

(when generating the domain prototype, do we want to load the existing template at all, especially at the root of the Verber::Federated hierarchy.  Because perhaps we want to have those autogenerated by the domain.   Well I guess by default don't load them, but you can possibly load them in the Federated subclasses as needed)
